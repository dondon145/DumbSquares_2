This is a sand game. It is not optimized. I won't add any features anymore to this version, as it needs to be completely refactored in order to add new features.
I don't plan to fix anything bugged in here either.

It currently has: 
- sand
- water
- static stone

To do:
- non-static stone
- lava
- fire
- smoke

To-Do (Recommended features)
- Make sand sink in water
- Make water and sand react to a falling stone 

Performance:

- 60 fps (3,000 particles)
- 30-40 fps (7,000 particles)
- 17-20 fps (15,000 particles)
- 7-10 fps (40,000 particles)

(Plugged-in) 
- 55-60 fps (6,000 particles)

- 10 fps (50,000 particles)
- 7 fps (71,000 particles)
